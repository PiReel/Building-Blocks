	Kip Omaha is an amateur science web site that offers web apps via your own secure portal or through one of 
    our special programs or drives. A large part of what Kip does is for free (<b>Not for profit*</b>), our product sales and promotional 
    drives are designed to help our bottom line. Even after that we still need help especially as we get started 
    up. Go see our <a href="#">goFundMe.com</a> page if you want to make a contribution to our cause or make a
	contribution via paypal through <a href="#">kipOmaha.org/donate.html</a>.

	The Drive for Drives is a program designed to help students get a much needed thumb drive. Here at Kip we take unwanted
    thumb drives and turn them into something new and special. Each thumb drive is wiped clean and packaged with our IDE program
    for students. Kip offers the drives for free but we put out collection boxes so our supporters can easily donate
    to our cause.<br>
    If your interested in seeing a list of vendors that participate in the program click <a href="#" target="new">here</a>.
