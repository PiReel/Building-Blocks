### Why PISEA?  
We chose PISEA because it gives people (smart people) the power to express themselves in unique ways. In the digital age, applications developed for the cloud enable people to express themselves in a safe way and a safe place. Alas, their doesn't seem to be any completely free to use cloud developed animator for the engineers and scientists to use and collaborate on.  

During Mozsprint 2017 we will be actively discussing the topic of, "methods of communicating VIA the web", in the hopes of starting to put together a list of different methods of communication. This information will later be used to categorize the different type of web communicators to find correlations between communicator preferences and application development. In other words what can we do to stimulate high quality open source work done on the cloud?
