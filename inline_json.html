	This page is dedicated to Kip's Inline JSON project. The Inline JSON project is an effort to document the rules for inline JSON. This project
    follows guide lines laid out by the <a href="http://ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf">ECMA-404</a> although 
    the original work done by Mr. Crockford was submitted as <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159">RFC 4627</a> in July 2006.<br><br>

    Please keep in mind that inline JSON is not implemented as an allowed format in any popular browser, if you want to use inline JSON you will
    have to find a library or you can use Kip's <a href="djBase.html">djBase.js</a> library. If you use another Javascript library itâ€™s not guaranteed
    that they followed all the rules and guide lines that are stated here, please be safe and check their documentation.<br><br>

    Inline JSON's intent is to implement a data format that is compatible across multiple platforms inside of an HTML document. It can be considered a part
    of a family of syntaxes that are allowed to be used as values inside HTML attributes. Inline JSON unlike the other syntax inside of an html doc 
    is not a technology that is used mainly or primarily for styling or scripting logic. The JSON format can be used for information systems or more 
    specifically in a data exchange process between two servers or programs.<br><br>

    Inline JSON is a working project and is currently looking for reviewers, if you're interested in volunteering please contact kipOmaha@gmail.com.

	JSON is a syntax for sending and receiving information. Its compatibility with multiple programming languages makes it appealing for
    cross platform development. Languages that are compatible include:
    					<ol>
                        	<li>Javascript *</li>
                        	<li>PHP</li>
                        	<li>Python</li>
                        </ol>
	This list doesn't mean that the language you use doesn't support JSON. To be sure that your language is compatible you should 
    check the documentation of the language that you are currently programming with.<br><br>
    JSON was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Douglas Crockford</a>, you can learn more about Douglas Crockford
    and his career on Wikipedia. His most current works and information about him can be found at 
    <a href="www.crockford.com">www.crockford.com</a>. Mr. Crockford, keeps all JSON schema data at <a href="www.json.org">www.json.org</a>,
    kipOmaha.org does not claim to have any affiliation with the JSON.org name, brand, ect, this is an independent JSON project being conducted for

					<h3><a name="Syntax_Rules_of_Json">Syntax Rules of Inline JSON</a></h3>
                    <section>
	The most current rules for the JSON syntax can be downloaded as a pdf file
    <a href="http://ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf">here</a>.<br><br>

	(This document declares each time it refers to inline JSON by its full name to deter confusion)<br><br>

    This projects goal is to add the current JSON standard to the data-json HTML attribute. The data-json attribute
    was chosen because it conforms to the HTML data- attribute rules and is an explicit description of what the attribute
    stores. Although, the intent is not to change the JSON syntax, the following are some recommendations for
    an inline variety of JSON, I am pushing for the following changes and additions to be made for the implementation of Inline JSON:
    					<ol>
                        	<li>Single or double quotes allowed.</li>
                        	<li>White space or commas between property and value pairs.</li>
                        	<li>Add the following global properties:
                            	<ol style="list-style:upper-alpha;">
									<li>id: [ string value same as id attr ]</li>
									<li>class: [ string value same as id attr ]</li>
									<li>name: [ string value same as id attr ]</li>
									<li>html: [ string value same as tag name ]</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        	<li>Setting the JSON global properties are the same as setting the html element attributes and tag name values.</li>
						</ol>
     The point to these changes is to create a JSON syntax that has overlapping rules with the html document making it easier and quicker to code
     with JSON on an html page.<br><br>
     Below is an example of a valid inline json:<br><br>
     					<code style="margin:3mm;">
	 &lt;div id="myElementId" class="myElementClass" name="myElementName" data-json="{<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;'id': 'myElementId'<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;'class': 'myElementClass'<br>
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;'name': 'myElementName'<br>
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;'html': 'div'<br>
     &nbsp;}"&gt;
	 &lt;/div&gt;
                        </code>
                    </section><br>
					<section>
	The standard should also include a Javascript method to retrieve the JSON data. For example:<br><br>
						<code>
	document.getJsonById("myElementId");<br>
    // returns JSON<br><br>
	document.getJsonByClassName("myElementClass");<br>
    // returns JSON node list<br><br>
	document.getJsonByName("myElementName");<br>
    // returns JSON node list<br><br>
	document.getJsonByTagName("myElementTagName");<br>
    // returns JSON node list<br><br>
						</code><br><br>
                    </section>
					<section>
	Recommendation 3 from this document outlines the global properties that would enable the Javascript methods to work for JSON.<br><br>

	The Javascript retrieval methods for JSON would mimic the element retrieval methods. Ideally the implementations would be set up
    so that the JSON and the element attribute values would be the same. With the exception of the html property of the inline 
    JSON, since their is no tag name attribute for the element.<br><br>
    
    What this means is that setting the JSON id property value would be the same as setting the id attribute value and vice versa.
    This would eliminate the need to duplicate attribute values. If you look at the example below you can see what the 
    recommendation is explaining:<br><br>
						<code>
	 &lt;div data-json="{<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;'id': 'myElementId'<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;'class': 'myElementClass'<br>
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;'name': 'myElementName'<br>
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;'html': 'div'<br>
     &nbsp;}"&gt;
	 &lt;/div&gt;<br><br>

	// Notice that the global attributes of the div element have been omitted. This was done intentionally, <br>
    // because the property values are set and will automatically set the values of the global attributes.
						</code>
                    </section>

					<section id="syntaxRulesConclusion">
						<h3>Syntax Rules Conclusion</h3>
						<section>
	Their are 4 recommended changes for the JSON format meant to have a mimimal effect on the JSON format itself, 
    but still enable the developer to have a useful set of tools to manipulate and retrieve JSON from an html document. 
    I have personally found that many rich relationships can be formed with this method,
	for instance the <code>JSON.stringify()</code> method could be manipulated 
    to retrieve the inline string of the json if available. Which could be useful if your JSON 
    uses some sort of dynamic stamping process to manipulate JSON strings.<br> 
    Below is a review the recommendations from the previous section:
                        </section><br>
    					<ol>
                        	<li>Single or double quotes allowed.</li>
                        	<li>White space or commas between property and value pairs.</li>
                        	<li>Add the following global properties:
                            	<ol style="list-style:upper-alpha;">
									<li>id: [ string value same as id attr ]</li>
									<li>class: [ string value same as id attr ]</li>
									<li>name: [ string value same as id attr ]</li>
									<li>html: [ string value same as tag name ]</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        	<li>Setting the JSON global properties are the same as setting the html element attributes and tag name values.</li>

						<h4>Potential Applications:</h4>
	The application's for an inline format such as JSON are primarily for web application development or widget development.
    The thought driving this recommendation is that you can use JSON in place of html attributes for web applications, this is 
    useful because JSON is compatible with javascript and many other languages and as a result much of the logic can be used in other scripting
    languages that may not support html directly. In essence it gives html a more robust and richer way of communicating with other platforms.<br><br>
    
    Kip Omaha is currently developing a web application library of inline JSON web apps. Many projects are going to be open source and some
    are closed source until a certain amount of money is raised, please visit our application library by clicking
    <a href="json_application_library.html">JSON Application Library</a>.
                   	</section>

					<section id="djbase">
						<h4>djBase.js</h4>
	Earlier we mentioned the djBase.js library. Before you decide to use the library be sure that you are fully aware of the instructions, warnings, notes,
    and licensing information regarding its use. Please click the link below if you would like to download djBase.js.<br>
    <a href="javascript.html">Javascript Library</a><br><br>
    The djBase.js library enables you to use inline JSON in an unobtrusive way. The script loads using the async attribute and searches for inline JSON
    that you request to be looked for VIA the update() function. The update() function offers one required parameter and two other optional parameters.
    The parameters:
						<ol>
							<li>_obj: Element node or element node list
               	        	<li>_array: An array object</li>
                   	    	<li>deep: Bolean value</li>
                       	</ol>
						<section>
	The 1st parameter is the html node or node list you want to be updated, the 2nd parameter gives you control over where your JSON get stored 
    for each update() used, and the 3rd allows you to easily update() any json nested inside the target element. If your interested in learning 
    more about the library you can view the reference through the <a href="djBase.html">djBase.html</a> documentation page.<br><br>

	If you would like to be a reviewer, commentor, sponsor, affiliate, donor, or developer of the djBase.js library please contact,
    kipOmaha@gmail.com.

	As this is an amateur science club, forum, and effort Kip Omaha feels its necessary to submit a formal proposal to a standards body, but first
    we need to collect feedback and write a more formal documentation concerning inline JSON. If your interested in helping with the formal
